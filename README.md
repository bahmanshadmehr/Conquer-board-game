# Conquer-board-game
This game was my first experience in unity. I finished this project for my Advanced programming teacher in the univercity. 
Well of course it was a lesson that i did not need to be at the class :).  
This project was a pain in the ass. But I enjoyed doing it.  
Actually I did not finished it all by my self. Miss Forugh Rahimi was my partner at this project.  
The best part about this game is an algorithm that will generate the map randomly based on a graph map that you can change inside the project.  
You can write the files based on some rules that i have commented in the project and then you can start the game.  
And also everytime that the game starts, the map will generate randomly. That is the best part :)  
The game is not available for public use but in the future I will put it in my website.
